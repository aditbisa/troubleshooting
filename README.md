# Troubleshooting

A collection from my personal troubleshooting in programming.

This collection is not about fixing business logic in the code, rather its about:
- fixing configuration,
- dealing with language/framework limitation,
- brain-fog problem,
- etc.


## The format

All the collection will be in markdown document for direct publish from github.
With the intention to be indexed later, hence some format identical to YAML.

Check the [template](./template.md).
