# Troubleshooting

A collection from my personal troubleshooting in programming.

This collection is not about fixing business logic in the code, rather its about:
- fixing configuration,
- dealing with language/framework limitation,
- brain-fog problem,
- **how-to** notes,
- etc.


## The format

All the collection will be in markdown document for direct publish from github.
With the intention to be indexed later, hence some format identical to YAML.

Use the [template](./template.md) and place in folder with the actual problem came from, be it the framework, language, or the environment.


## TODO

- index list
- commit hook to auto populate index
